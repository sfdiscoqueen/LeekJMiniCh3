Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Great use of bools as conditions for the while loops. I really liked the TryParse for the date format! Had no idea you could do that- very clever. Code ran great and I had no luck breaking it. Nice job with the line breaks. Good spacing made for a great user exprience. The only feedback I can think of is maybe throw in a ToLower() to account for users not following directions and typing 'End' or 'END' to quit the game. Really good work!
